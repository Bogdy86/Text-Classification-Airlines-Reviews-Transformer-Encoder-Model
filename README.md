# Text-Classification-Airlines-Reviews-Transformer-Encoder-Model
## Overview
This project builds a Transformer-based text classification model to analyze airline reviews and predict sentiment.

## Project Goals
- Classify customer reviews automatically
- Understand sentiment patterns in airline feedback
- Explore Transformer encoder architecture for NLP tasks

- ## Dataset
Airline customer reviews dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
Text data was cleaned and normalized by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing sentences, and padded to ensure uniform input length. The text was then encoded into numerical representations suitable for input into the Transformer model.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NLP preprocessing
- Transformer Encoder
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Architecture
The model uses a Transformer encoder to capture contextual relationships between words and improve classification accuracy.

## Results
The model learns patterns in customer feedback and predicts sentiment automatically.
