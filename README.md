- Understand sentiment patterns in airline feedback
- Explore Transformer encoder architecture for NLP tasks

- ## Dataset
Airline customer reviews dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NLP preprocessing
- Transformer Encoder
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Architecture
The model uses a Transformer encoder to capture contextual relationships between words and improve classification accuracy.

## Results
The model learns patterns in customer feedback and predicts sentiment automatically.
